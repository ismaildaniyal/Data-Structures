# Text Editor

This C++ project demonstrates the practical application of advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) within the framework of a simple yet powerful Notepad application. It integrates efficient techniques for text manipulation, storage, and compression, making it a valuable tool for both developers and DSA enthusiasts.

## üöÄ Features

### Notepad Application
- **Basic Text Editing**: Create, edit, and save text files with ease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive console-based UI for seamless interaction.

### Trie Tree Integration
- **Efficient Word Storage**: Store and retrieve words in real-time.
- **Autocomplete Support**: Instantly suggest completions for partially typed words.
- **Quick Search Operations**: Perform fast and reliable word lookups.

### Huffman Encoding and Decoding
- **Text Compression**: Utilize Huffman coding to reduce text file sizes efficiently.
- **Decompression**: Reconstruct the original text from Huffman-encoded files.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build and Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-editor.git
   cd text-editor
   ```

2. **Compile the Source Code**:
   Use your preferred C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o text_editor main.cpp trie.cpp huffman.cpp -std=c++17
   ```

3. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./text_editor
   ```

## üìö How It Works

### Trie Tree
- **Structure**: A multi-way tree structure used for storing strings efficiently.
- **Applications**: Supports operations like insertion, search, and auto-complete with high performance.

### Huffman Coding
- **Compression**: Encodes characters using variable-length codes based on their frequencies.
- **Algorithm**: Builds a binary tree (Huffman Tree) for optimal encoding.
- **Decompression**: Decodes text using the Huffman Tree to reconstruct the original file.

## üí° Use Cases
- Text editors and word processors.
- Efficient storage and retrieval systems.
- File compression utilities.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Data Structures**: Trie Tree, Priority Queue (used in Huffman Coding)
- **Algorithms**: Huffman Coding, String Manipulation
